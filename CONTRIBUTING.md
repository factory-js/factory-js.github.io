# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FactoryJS documentation.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository from [GitHub link](https://github.com/factory-js/factory-js.github.io/fork) and clone it. [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) would be helpful.

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/factory-js.github.io.git
   cd factory-js.github.io
   ```

1. Install the pnpm with [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Run the following in the project root:

   ```sh
   corepack enable pnpm
   ```

1. Install packages.

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

1. Create a branch and checkout.

   ```sh
   git switch -c your-new-branch-name
   ```

1. Code and commit your changes.

   ```sh
   git commit -m 'add a new feature'
   ```

1. Run linters in the project root before pushing the PR.

   ```sh
   pnpm run secretlint
   pnpm run type-check
   pnpm run lint
   pnpm run format
   ```

1. Push your changes and open the PR.

   ```sh
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

1. Rename your PR title to comply with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). CI will automatically verify this.  
   You don't need to change commit messages because we use squash merge.  
   Generally, you can use the `docs:` when you intend to improve or fix documentation, and it is rare that you will need to use other types.

1. Please ensure all CI checks have passed. That's all! ðŸŽ‰
