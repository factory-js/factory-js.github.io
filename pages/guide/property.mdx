## Overwriting Property Values

To overwrite the property values of a factory, use `.props`. In the example below, the value of `firstName` is overwritten from `John` to `Alice`.

```ts {11}
import { factory } from "@factory-js/factory";

const userFactory = factory.define({
  props: {
    firstName: () => "John",
    lastName: () => "Doe",
  },
  vars: {},
});

const user = await userFactory.props({ firstName: () => "Alice" }).build();

console.log(user); // 👉 { "firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Doe" }
```

`.props` can be called multiple times in a method chain. If the same property value is overwritten multiple times, the last value takes precedence.

```ts {12}
const user = await userFactory
  .props({ firstName: () => "Alice", lastName: () => "Smith" })
  .props({ firstName: () => "Bob" })
  .props({ firstName: () => "Tom" })
  .build();

console.log(user); // 👉 { firstName: "Tom", lastName: "Smith" }
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You cannot add new properties with `.props`. You can only overwrite the values
  of properties defined in `.define`. If you want to add properties, refer to
  [Extending Factory](./extending-factory).
</Callout>

## Defining Dependent Properties

You can also define properties that reference the values of other properties. In the example below, the value of `fullName` is generated based on the values of `firstName` and `lastName`.

```ts {7,14}
const userFactory = factory
  .define({
    props: {
      firstName: () => "John",
      lastName: () => "Doe",
      // Dependent properties cannot be defined within `.define`, so set an empty string initially
      fullName: () => "",
    },
    vars: {},
  })
  .props({
    fullName: async ({ props }) =>
      // Since there might be a Promise, you need to use `await` to get the property values
      `${await props.firstName} ${await props.lastName}`,
  });

// 👇 { fullName: "John Doe", firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" }
console.log(await userFactory.build());
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Avoid creating properties that reference each other circularly, as this could
  result in an infinite loop.
</Callout>

Note that dependent properties cannot be defined within `.define`. Therefore, you need to set a dummy value such as an empty string initially and then overwrite the value later with `.props`. This constraint helps keep the object within `.define` simple, allowing TypeScript to correctly infer types.

<Callout type="info">
  FactoryJS provides a function called `later` to easily define placeholder. For
  more details, refer to [Placeholder](./placeholder).
</Callout>

A convenient aspect of this feature is that it works correctly even if you change the value of a property later. For example, in the following example, the value of `firstName` is changed from `John` to `Tom` after setting the value of `fullName`, and the value of `fullName` is updated automatically.

```ts
const userFactory = factory
  .define({
    props: {
      firstName: () => "John",
      lastName: () => "Doe",
      fullName: "",
    },
    vars: {},
  })
  .props({
    fullName: async ({ props }) =>
      `${await props.firstName} ${await props.lastName}`,
  });

const user = await userFactory.props({ firstName: () => "Tom" }).build();

// 👇 { fullName: "Tom Doe", firstName: "Tom", lastName: "Doe" }
console.log(await userFactory.build());
```
