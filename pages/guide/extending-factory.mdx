## Extending a Factory

There may be times when you want to create a new factory that adds properties or variables to an existing factory. In such cases, you can use `.def`. In the example below, a new `employeeFactory` is defined by reusing the properties and variables defined in `userFactory`.

```ts {14}
import { factory } from "@factory-js/factory";

const userFactory = await factory.define({
  props: {
    name: () => "John",
    age: () => 20,
  },
  vars: {
    title: () => "Mr.",
  },
});

// Use `.def` to get the properties and variables from `userFactory`
const { props, vars } = userFactory.def;

const employeeFactory = await factory.define({
  props: {
    ...props,
    role: () => "admin",
  },
  vars: {
    ...vars,
    greeting: () => "Hello",
  },
});
```

Note that the properties and variables returned by `.def` are those defined at the time of `.define`. This means that results from method chains using `.props` or `.vars` to overwrite values later are not considered. The reason for this is that it is possible to define values dependent on other properties or variables within a method chain, and reusing them is very challenging due to TypeScript limitations.

```ts {12,16}
import { factory } from "@factory-js/factory";

const userFactory = await factory
  .define({
    props: {
      name: () => "John",
    },
    vars: {},
  })
  // Here, `name` is overwritten to "Tom", but this is not reflected in the `.def` result
  .props({
    name: () => "Tom",
  });

// The `props.name` returned here is "John", not "Tom"
const { props } = userFactory.def;

const employeeFactory = await factory.define({
  props: {
    ...props,
    role: () => "admin",
  },
  vars: {},
});

console.log(await employeeFactory.build()); // ðŸ‘‰ { name: "John", role: "admin" }
```
