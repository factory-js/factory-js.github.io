## Defining Placeholders

When defining dependent properties or variables, you cannot reference other properties or variables within `.define`, so sometimes you may want to set placeholder values. In such cases, you can use `later` to define only the type, setting the actual value later.

```ts {9,15-16}
import { factory, later } from "@factory-js/factory";

const userFactory = factory
  .define({
    props: {
      firstName: () => "John",
      lastName: () => "Doe",
      // Define only the type to allow TypeScript to infer it, and set the actual value later
      fullName: later<string>(),
    },
    vars: {},
  })
  .props({
    // Set the value of `fullName` here
    fullName: async ({ props }) =>
      `${await props.firstName} ${await props.lastName}`,
  });
```

If you use this factory without setting the value of this property later, `later` will throw an exception. This way, you can catch mistakes if you forget to set the value.

```ts
import { factory, later } from "@factory-js/factory";

const userFactory = factory.define({
  props: {
    firstName: () => "John",
    lastName: () => "Doe",
    fullName: later<string>(),
  },
  vars: {},
});

userFactory.build(); // ❌ Throws an exception because `fullName` is not set
```

## Defining Properties Without Default Values

Another use of `later` is to define properties without default values. In the example below, the `type` property is defined with `later`.

```ts {5} filename="factories/item-factory.ts"
import { factory, later } from "@factory-js/factory";

export const itemFactory = factory.define({
  props: {
    type: later<"book" | "food">(),
    price: () => 0,
  },
  vars: {},
});
```

By defining properties this way, you ensure that values must be set in advance using `.props` when creating objects with the factory. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

```ts {8,16}
import { expect, it, describe } from "vitest";
import { itemFactory } from "../factories/item-factory";
import { isFood } from "./is-food";

describe("when the type is food", () => {
  it("returns true", async () => {
    // ✅ No exception is thrown because `type` is set
    const item = await itemFactory.props({ type: () => "food" }).build();
    expect(isFood(item)).toBe(true);
  });
});

describe("when the type is book", () => {
  it("returns false", async () => {
    // ❌ Throws an exception because `type` is not set
    const item = await itemFactory.build();
    expect(isFood(item)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```
