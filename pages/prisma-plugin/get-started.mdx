## Introduction

FactoryJS provides a plugin for Prisma. By using this plugin, you can automatically generate factories from Prisma schema files.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, FactoryJS only provides a plugin for Prisma. However, you can
  manually define factories to use with other ORMs. For more details, refer to
  the [Get Started](../other-orms/get-started) section in Other ORMs.
</Callout>

## Installation

To use the Prisma plugin, install the `@factory-js/factory` and `@factory-js/prisma-factory` packages. Run the following command to install the packages:

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```sh
    pnpm add -D @factory-js/factory @factory-js/prisma-factory
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```sh
    npm i --save-dev @factory-js/factory @factory-js/prisma-factory
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```sh
    yarn add -D @factory-js/factory @factory-js/prisma-factory
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setup

After installing the packages, add the `generator` setting to your Prisma schema file as follows:

```prisma {10-12}
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

generator factory {
  provider = "prisma-factory"
}

...
```

The setup is now complete. Let's generate the factories. Run the following command to generate the factories in the `./generated/factories.ts` directory:

```sh
prisma generate
```

## Usage

To use the automatically generated factories, import them from `./generated/factories.ts` as shown below. Use `.create` to create objects.

```ts
import { defineUserFactory } from "./generated/factories";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const db = new PrismaClient();
const userFactory = await defineUserFactory(db);

it("returns an admin user", async () => {
  const user = userFactory.props({ role: () => "ADMIN" }).create();
  expect(user.role).toBe("ADMIN");
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  It is recommended to create a directory like `/factories` rather than
  importing directly from `./generated/factories.ts`. For more details, refer to
  [Best Practice](./best-practice).
</Callout>

The Prisma plugin not only creates the model but also handles one-to-one and one-to-many relationships required for the model when you call `.create`, saving them all to the database. Therefore, you typically do not need to specify relationships. However, there may be cases where you want to change the relationships for a specific test case. In such cases, you can use `.vars` to change them. The example below changes the relationship to create an admin user's profile.

```ts {6}
const userFactory = await defineUserFactory(db);
const profileFactory = await defineProfileFactory(db);

it("create an admin profile", async () => {
  const user = userFactory.props({ role: () => "ADMIN" }).create();
  const profile = profileFactory.vars({ user: () => user }).create();
  expect(profile.userId).toBe(user.id);
});
```
